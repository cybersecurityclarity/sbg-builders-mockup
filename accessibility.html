          <p>
            SBG Builders (“we,” “our,” or the “Company”) is committed to diversity, inclusion, and accessibility.
            These values are central to how we design, develop, and deliver our digital content and services,
            including our website(s), applications, and other online tools (collectively, the “Digital Properties”).
            We strive to ensure that our Digital Properties are accessible to everyone, including individuals with
            disabilities.
          </p>

          <h2>Commitment to Accessibility</h2>
          <p>
            We are actively working to make our Digital Properties accessible and usable by people of all abilities
            and disabilities. To achieve this, we follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 Level AA
            as our standard for accessibility. These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible for
            people with visual, auditory, cognitive, and motor impairments.
          </p>

          <h2>Standards and Ongoing Efforts</h2>
          <p>
            We are continuously working to improve accessibility features and regularly review and update our Digital
            Properties to enhance usability. Efforts may include:
          </p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Designing new content in accordance with recognized accessibility standards.</li>
            <li>Conducting periodic reviews and testing for accessibility compliance.</li>
            <li>Incorporating user feedback and accessibility best practices into ongoing development.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Despite these efforts, portions of our Digital Properties may not yet meet all accessibility standards.
            Some content or third-party features may be temporarily inaccessible to some users, and we are committed
            to addressing these areas over time.
          </p>

          <h2>Known Limitations</h2>
          <p>
            While we work to make our entire Digital Properties accessible, there are situations where full conformance
            may not yet be achievable:
          </p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Some third-party content or widgets not fully controlled by SBG Builders could have accessibility barriers.</li>
            <li>Archived content or older pages may not meet current accessibility standards.</li>
            <li>We aim to address accessibility issues as they are identified and prioritized.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Compatibility and Technical Support</h2>
          <p>
            Our Digital Properties are designed to be compatible with modern assistive technologies and devices.
            However, some combinations of browsers and assistive tools (such as screen readers or magnification
            software) might not be fully supported in all cases.
          </p>

          <h2>Feedback and Contact Information</h2>
          <p>
            We welcome your feedback on the accessibility of SBG Builders’ Digital Properties. If you encounter
            accessibility barriers or have suggestions to improve access, please contact us:
          </p>
          <p>
            Email: <a href="mailto:info@sbgbuilders.com">info@sbgbuilders.com</a>
          </p>

          <p>When reporting an issue, please include:</p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>The specific web page or feature where the issue occurred</li>
            <li>The type of accessibility challenge you experienced</li>
            <li>The device, browser, or assistive technology you were using</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            We will do our best to respond within a reasonable timeframe and work toward a solution.
          </p>

          <h2>Review and Updates</h2>
          <p>
            This Accessibility Statement is reviewed at least annually and updated whenever significant changes are made
            to our Digital Properties or accessibility practices.
